# BPC (GSoC Project)
This app will allow you to connect single or multiple bots from Botpress with your Rocket.Chat server

## Configure BPC
 1. Create a user in rocket.chat
 2. Configure the BPC
    * Rocket.Chat bot username: (the username of user you want to connect with the bot)

## Use case
 1. Chat in the same room with multiple bots
    - When you want to talk with bots, then you should mention (@'botUsername') the bot's username, that you want to talk to
 2. Chat with bots in each room
    - You should not mention their username. You can have a conversation with each bot like a normal user

## Limitation
 - Bots can send only images or texts
